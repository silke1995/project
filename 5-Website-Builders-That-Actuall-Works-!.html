        <h2><b>Top 5 Website Builders That Actuall Works !</b></h2>
        <p><b>

             with less to spend on a web developer.

            Though many platforms provide simple, drag and drop tools that make creating
             a website simple and straightforward,

    <hr>
   
    <p>If you’re considering about using this builder for your next website, 
      then here are some of the vital pros and cons of WIX to consider before you get started.</p>

    <h3><b>Pros Of Wix Websites</b></h3>
    <h4><b>1. Free to use for everyone</b></h4>
      <p> Wix website builder platform is free to use for everyone. It means anyone
       with basic computer and internet knowledge 
       can use it anytime and anywhere on any device, within their web browser.</p>

    <h4><b> 2. Improved design templates.</b></h4>
    <p>
        The templates are designed by top quality and ranked graphics designers. 
        So you don’t need to worry about designs, layouts, responsiveness and website structure.
        With the drag-and-drop design functions that Wix offers, you can have 
        a stylish website created in any minutes. This enables individuals or business
         to get online with a commercial or personal site without a large investment. Some
         of the templates are limited with the free plan, but otherwise, you receive
          an immediate and solid user experience.</p>

      <h4><b> 3. The interface is inherent and useful.</b></h4>
      <p>
          It isn’t the best looking backend interface that you’ll find with a website builder today,
          but it is incredibly useful. All of the tools you need are a few clicks away. 
          You also get guidelines and tools to customize templates, even on the free plan,
          so your website can match the look of your brand.</p>
      
      <h4><b> 4. You’re not locked into long-term plans.</b></h4>
      <p>
          To get an affordable premium plan, many website builders lock you into 24-36 month contracts. 
          You don’t have that issue with Wix.
           If you want to upgrade from the free option, you can try it out for as 
           little as $5 per month and cancel at any time.</p>

    <h4><b> 5. Site security without compromising speed.</b></h4>
    <p>
      Wix websites perform at above-average rates for speed.
      You don’t need to worry about security because the site
      is hosted on a Wix server. This means you get to worry 
      more about designing your site and taking advantage of 
      the services you may have purchased from their numerous premium bundles.
       </p>

    <h4><b> 6. You receive an all-in-one solution.</b></h4>
    <p>If you run into a problem with your site for some reason, 
        all you need to do is contact Wix to get the solution you need.
         There’s no time spent tracking down issues or trying to deal 
         with plugins or widgets that may have malfunctioned. 
        You can contact their customer service depart via email, phone,
         or what amounts to an interactive FAQ page.</p>
    
  <h3><b>Cons Of Wix</b></h3>
  <h4><b> 1. Cannot support complex substructures.</b></h4>
  <p>
      Not perfect for large business websites (more than 30 pages),
       because the navigation menu cannot support complex substructures.
        So the depth of navigation is only two levels deep.</p>

<h4><b> 2. The starter plan doesn’t remove ads from your site.</b></h4>
<p>
    In the free version, you can’t access all the functionality and features.
     Such as if you want to access all the good design elements, or if you want your domain without Wix ads.
    To remove the ads, you must go to a different monthly plan 
    that will cost more than most of the website building competitors that are out there right now.</p>
  
<h4><b> 3. Drag and drop designs can limit your creativity.</b></h4>
<p>
    You can’t create your own designs ideas. For example,
     if you want different designs with various unique user experiences 
     it’s not easy to do in Wix. Starting with Wix is easy but once done
     its hard to give it a bespoke touch.
    Although the website builder has advanced dramatically in the 
    last couple of years, you still have certain constraints. 
    You can drag and drop items anywhere instead of into locked boxes,
     but it still can be a trouble to get a design to look and work the
      way expected. It takes much more time, in reality, to design a site 
      on Wix than most people will think it does.
    </p>
  
<h4><b> 4. Lack of total control and advanced features</b></h4>
<p>
    It’s difficult to customize everything. Sure they have
     provided drag and drop functionality but making significant changes to an existing site can be a hassle on Wix.
     Also, Wix changes the image file name after encryption, 
     which can be a limitation in terms of Image searchability.</p>

<h4><b> 5. SEO is hard with Wix.</b></h4>
<p>
    You do have access to an SEO Wizard with Wix that can help 
    you maximize content optimization, but the techniques offered
     are a little behind the times. Most of the focus is on keyword 
     targeting, grouping, and ranking without any consideration of
      other aspects of modern SEO. It may not be a deal-breaker, 
      but it will be a disadvantage to those who are looking at a long-term website effort.
    </p>

  <h3><b>Recommended? YES.</b></h3>
  <p>
      Wix was one of the easiest site builders we have ever tested.
      And yet, it’s simple to use, fast and reliable.</p>

  <h2><b><a href="https://www.squarespace.com"> 2.Squarespace </a></b></h2>
  <p>Squarespace provides a hosting server (where your website files live) along with custom software 
    so that you can design & edit your website files yourself. When you get started, 
    you get an account and a website builder dashboard to create your website design,
     pages, and media that you can "publish" to a website that has a custom domain.</p>

  <br>
  <hr>
  <p>If you’re thinking about using this builder for your next website, 
    then here are some of the essential pros and cons of Squarespace to consider before you get started.</p><br>
    <hr>

 <h3><b>Pros of  Squarespace </b></h3>

 <h4><b> 1. Offers  Templates and Design that are ready for publication.</b></h4>
 <p>
    Compared to other popular platforms, Squarespace has several templates. But all of these are of the highest quality.
    They offer more than 100+ advanced templates that are optimized
     for tablets and phones. Their templates are also highly customizable
    through the mobile site menu.
    Squarespace allows you to upload your design if you prefer.</p>

  <h4><b> 2. Mobile-Friendly Site</b></h4>
  <p> No matter what changes you make in the design and layout of the site, 
    it will automatically adjust with the screen 
    size of the user’s device. All Squarespace sites are responsive, 
    which is very important for SEO purposes these days.</p> 
  
<h4><b> 3. Technical Aspects and Customer support are always available with Squarespace</b></h4>
<p>
    Squarespace looks after all the technical aspects of your site.
     From hosting to security and software updates, everything is 
     taken care of by Squarespace. You don’t have to worry about your
      site getting hacked or any other technical aspects. You can just focus on building your site.
    You receive 24/7 support through email tickets and live chat boxes on this platform.</p>

<h3><b>Cons Of Squarespace</b></h3>

<h4><b> 1. Expensive Plans</b></h4>
<p>Squarespace is a bit more pricey. However,
   if you have the budget and if it is not for some serious business, 
   I would say go for it. It’s deserving. If the site grows with passing 
   time and you feel Squarespace is not providing you with what you need
    (yes, you might feel that way, especially because of the restricted 
    scope of adding external functionalities), you can always export your site to WordPress.
  </p>

<h4><b> 2. No Free Plan</b></h4>
<p> Unlike most of the other website builders, there is no 
  free plan on Squarespace. There is a 14-day trial
   period after which you will have to upgrade to a paid plan.</p>

<h4><b> 3. Lack of advanced marketing tools.</b></h4>
<p>
    People don’t just show up to your website
     because you’ve published it. They need to know about it.
      Squarespace gives you all of the basics for marketing, 
      including the all-important share buttons,
       but the advanced tools are lacking at best. 
       You do have URL redirect options, but SEO is
        pretty lacking and limited to basic meta structure. 
    </p>

<h2><b>Recommended?</b></h2>
<p> I feel if you can afford it, you can go for it.
   It is particularly good for storytellers, photographers, 
  and artists. It is also a good option for small businesses.
   However, I won’t suggest it for large e-commerce sites.</p>

   is a great platform for those looking for a free plan to start a blog.
    It gives you a chance to start a website for free. And if you
     find you need more features like custom domain name support, 
     more storage space, or custom designs, you can upgrade from your
      free plan to a premium WordPress.com plan.</p>

<h3><b>Pros Of Wordpress.com</b></h3>

<h4><b> 1. Free to Use</b></h4>
<p>You don’t need to purchase a domain name or web hosting. WordPress.com provides 
  a free subdomain and hosts your site’s data for you at no extra cost.
   It also provides 3GB of free space.</p>

<h4><b> 2. Easy to Set Up</b></h4>
<p>
  All you have to do to start using <a href="wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> 
  is to create an account and give your site and URL a name.</p>

<h4><b> 3. Easy Maintenance</b></h4>
<p>
  You don’t have to handle things like updates or backups since WordPress.com handles that for you.</p>

<h3><b>Cons Of Wordpress.com</b></h3>

<h4><b> 1. Ad Displays</b></h4>
<p>
    All free WordPress.com websites have 
    ads displayed on them. This means your site visitors see these ads. 
    You also don’t make money off these ads. To get rid of the ads displaying on your site, 
    you must upgrade to a premium plan.
    </p>

<h4><b> 2. No Site Identity</b></h4>
<p>With the free WordPress.com platform, you are not allowed to have a custom domain name. 
  You can set up a free subdomain to get around this, but the URL is often long and hard for site visitors to identify. <br>
    Your free WordPress.com URL will look like this: http://yoursite.wordpress.com/ <br>
    This tells everyone you’re using the free WordPress platform and can appear unprofessional.
     It also restricts your ability to represent your brand and establish an identity.
    Your site will display a powered by WordPress link that can only be removed by
     upgrading to the premium Business plan. <br>
    And to top it off, you do not own your website like you do when you use WordPress.org.
     If at any time they feel you’ve violated the Terms of Service, they can delete your entire site.</p>

     <h4><b> 3. No Monetization</b></h4>
     <p>
      You are not allowed to sell direct ads on your website or 
      use ad networks like Google AdSense. You can apply for the 
      WordAds program, but any revenue you generate will be shared with WordPress. 
      If you use the Premium or Business plans you can use WordAds right away.
      Also, you cannot participate in or make money from affiliate links when
       you use the free plan.</p>
    
    <h4><b> 4. Limited Customization</b></h4>
    <p>
      With WordPress.com, you cannot install
       any custom themes on your site. Instead,
        you are limited to the few free themes available.
      The Premium plan and higher provide access to
       premium themes. They can also use custom CSS.</p>


  <h4><b> 5. No Plugins</b></h4>
  <p>
    Just as you can’t use themes on your 
    free WordPress site, you can’t install 
    plugins either. 
    Though all WordPress.com sites do come
     with Jetpack vital features, that’s it unless you pay more.

        SiteBuilder is overall a good choice for anyone desiring to
         build a website quickly and affordably. Their most effective selling
         points would be how easy their editor is to use and the fact that
          you get a free domain with any paid plan.</p>

        <p>Jimdo is a website-builder and all-in-one hosting solution, 
          designed to enable users to build their websites without any web design experience.</p>
        
        <h3><b>Pro Of Jimdo</b></h3>
         <h4><b> 1. Ease of use</b></h4>
         <p>
            The editor is made for complete beginners. Adding and editing elements
             can be done with a few clicks. The style menu is a great visual 
            tool for site-wide changes like font size or colours. This is a huge
             timesaver and makes editing straightforward.</p>
        
             <h4><b> 2. SEO</b></h4>
             <p>
                Optimizing your website for search engines is one of Jimdo’s big strengths. 
                The backend gives you full control over page elements such as the page title, 
                description and URL. Also, they use SSL-encryption, which is a ranking 
                factor for search engines. If that’s not enough, Jimdo’s paid Ranking Coach
                 tool can further help you understand SEO.</p>

          <h4><b> 3. Mobile App</b></h4>
          <p>
              Jimdo’s app is one of the best in the market in terms of creating a website 
              with a tablet or mobile phone. It’s available for both Android and iOS.</p>
   
      <h4><b> 4. Great support</b></h4>
      <p>
          Jimdo scored high marks with the quality of their answers. 
          They are not always the fastest but will typically resolve your issues right away.</p>

    <h3><b>Cons Of Jimdo</b></h3>

    <h4><b> 1. Lack Of  templates Flexibility</b></h4>
    <p>	
        
        Sometimes you just want to move things around. 
        However, due to some template restrictions,
         this is not always easy (or, in some cases, even possible). </p>

    <h4><b> 2. Online store</b></h4>
    <p>
        Even though Jimdo has a pretty decent integrated 
        online store, unfortunately, it’s not the best choice 
        for US-sellers. The problem 
        is that there’s no credit card gateway available. 
        Currently, you can only offer manual payments or PayPal.</p>

  <h2><b>Recommended?</b></h2>
  <p>Jimdo provides a Web hosting service that presents everything you need to make your website. 
    You can make anything from a business site or blog to an eCommerce store – all without having to use code!</p>

<h2><b>In Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>Website builder tools have truly advanced over the past few years and 
  it’s good if your purpose is to build a personal
   site, unfunded startup, small non-profit, small community, unproven concept etc.
 
    In-short Website builders are awesome if you need to build static 
    pages, plus galleries, forms, testimonials etc & that you don’t care much about cutting-edge SEO at present.
     
    If you are planning a larger site with complex site architecture and 
    connect with the database then building a custom website of using the
     CMS platforms such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal and so on will be the correct alternative.</p>
